To use the find Shortest path option in the Options.txt:
Between "Shortest Path - Start:" and "End"
add the start node and goal node SEPARATED BY A SINGLE SPACE AND ON THEIR OWN LINE (as in the example in the default Option.txt)

*also note, shortest path only uses those nodes that are not removed by the degree threshold

The paths between the nodes you indicated (if they exist) will be saved to new .csv file (which can be styled using the same style sheet as the normal results)

In order to use the "Combine" option, you list out the substring contained in the names of the nodes you would like to combine into singular group nodes based on their attributes, or put: none
